# 🚛 TowChain MVP

**A blockchain-based towing dispatch and fleet management system designed to bring automation, transparency, and trust to the logistics industry.**

---

## 📦 Project Overview

TowChain is a decentralized application (dApp) MVP designed to support towing operators and small logistics businesses in managing dispatch jobs, tracking performance, and ensuring contract compliance through smart contracts.

This MVP lays the foundation for a scalable on-chain solution that empowers fleet managers, drivers, and subcontractors through automation, escrow-based payments, and real-time updates.

---

## 🔍 Use Case

TowChain addresses key challenges in the towing and logistics industry:

- Manual dispatching and job assignment
- Delayed or disputed payments to drivers
- Lack of transparency in job tracking and completion
- No performance-based incentive or penalty enforcement
- Limited access to trustless systems for small operators

By deploying this MVP on-chain, TowChain introduces automated job lifecycle management, milestone-based payments, and performance accountability.
